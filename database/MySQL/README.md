# MySQL Directory

This directory is dedicated to the implementation details of the MySQL database used by our custom JWT service. We've chosen MySQL, a renowned open-source relational database management system, as our platform for user authentication and security management.

## MySQL Overview

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system based on the SQL (Structured Query Language) programming language. It provides multi-user access to support many storage engines, each with its own set of features. MySQL is known for its reliability, robustness, and performance.

## Why MySQL for Cookify's JWT Service?

MySQL has been chosen as the preferred database technology for our JWT service because of the following reasons:

1. **Structured Data:** Our JWT service handles user login information which is highly structured. Relational databases like MySQL are designed to manage structured data efficiently.

2. **Security:** MySQL comes with robust data security layers which are essential for storing sensitive user information. It supports powerful mechanisms for ensuring only authorized users have access to the database.

3. **ACID Compliance:** MySQL is ACID compliant, ensuring the reliability of transactions, which is crucial for operations involving sensitive user data.

4. **Encryption:** MySQL supports data encryption at rest and in transit, providing another layer of security for sensitive user data.

5. **Ease of Integration:** MySQL easily integrates with numerous programming languages and platforms, making it a versatile choice for various applications.

## Our Implementation

Our custom JWT service is solely responsible for user login operations. It follows a structured model, where each user is associated with a unique JWT. These JWTs are encrypted using private-public key pairs, ensuring secure transmission of user credentials.

MySQL is used to securely store the structured user login data. Its security mechanisms, including data encryption and access control, protect sensitive user data, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of user information.

The use of MySQL for our JWT service ensures a reliable, secure, and efficient solution for managing user authentication in our application.
