# Hashicorp Consul Directory

This directory holds the implementation details of our use of HashiCorp Consul, a robust service networking solution to connect and secure services across any runtime platform and public or private cloud. We've leveraged Consul for service discovery, service mesh, health checking, and key/value storage in our Kubernetes (EKS) based microservices architecture.

## HashiCorp Consul Overview

HashiCorp Consul is a full-featured service mesh solution that provides service discovery, configuration, and segmentation functionalities. It employs a client-server architecture where the servers hold and replicate a set of data and the clients hold a smaller set and forward requests to servers when appropriate. 

## Why Consul for Cookify's EKS Cluster?

We chose Consul as our service mesh solution for several reasons:

1. **Service Discovery and Health Checking:** Consul provides a central registry for services to register themselves and to discover other services. Additionally, Consul provides built-in health checks to detect and handle failures at both the service and node level.

2. **Secure Service Communication:** With Consul, we are able to automatically secure service-to-service communication with automatic TLS encryption and identity-based authorization.

3. **Multi-Platform:** Consul is platform-agnostic and can run on any platform, including EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service), which allows us to maintain a consistent networking interface across different runtime platforms and environments.

4. **Key/Value Store:** Consul's built-in KV store is useful for storing configuration data and for coordination between services.

5. **Integrations:** It integrates perfectly with other HashiCorp tools such as Vault for managing secrets.

## Our Implementation

In our EKS cluster, Consul serves as the service mesh, providing secure and reliable interservice communication with mTLS. It also provides service discovery and health checking functionalities, helping our services to find and communicate with each other, and ensuring that unhealthy instances are avoided.

Consul is used as an ingress and load balancer for all of our microservices, managing traffic between services and ensuring optimal distribution of requests. It also serves as the storage backend for our HashiCorp Vault secrets store, offering a secure method for storing and managing sensitive information.

By leveraging Consul, we can ensure secure, reliable, and efficient communication between our microservices, thereby enhancing the overall functionality and reliability of our application.
